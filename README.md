# NetGAP
NetGAP/NeuralGAP Graph-Grammar based network generator.

## Usage
Example usage of the nework generator can be seen in the jupyter notebook files or in src/main.py

To generate a network one needs to specify a grammar, a use-case and an evaluator. Examples of evaluators are provided in the src/ directory and of grammars are provided in grammar/. The use case is loaded by the evaluator, examples are in data/.

A description of how to create grammars can be found on the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07778
